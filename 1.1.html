    <h1>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business
    </h1>

    <p>In the age of tech, data analysis has become part of our daily lexicon. Some say without it businesses would have a very difficult time competing. IT solutions are part of almost every process in the modern business, everything from security to customer satisfaction. Businesses have become heavily reliant on IT and we are now at a point that not having the right IT solutions could have severely detrimental outcomes.
    <p>IT not only helps with the systemic running of businesses but also brings us the level of quality and efficiency we have become accustomed to.
    <br> Service businesses are also using these tools to create meaningful impact wether intentionally or not, for example money transfer companies give people the opportunities to send money to relatives living in impoverished countries or the countless organisations that help vulnerable people around the world.
