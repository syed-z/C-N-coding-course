    <h2 class="about_me2">There's an easter egg on the home page. Did you find it? <br>It's the first step on the road to self discovery.</h2>

    <p>My approach to life is one of active growth and development, always striving to achieve quality above all else in my endeavours, a life lesson I teach my two wonderful children. 
        I pride myself on staying positive and approachable with the base ethos of cohesive and innovative engagement. I have honed my skills in identifying barriers and finding relevant solutions, delivering lasting results. My adaptability, analytical nature and focus on personal development allows me to demand the best from myself while supporting others to do the same, working in ever changing and often intense environments I derive a deep sense of purpose from meaningful challenges big or small.
